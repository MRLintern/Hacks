### The Reverse Cipher

## Introduction

This is a very basic cipher, and pretty weak in terms of security.

## How it Works

The user provides a word and the program reverses the word.

For example:

  `My credit card details are: 1234 5678 9101 1213` becomes: `3121 1019 8765 4321 :era sliated drac tiderc yM`.
