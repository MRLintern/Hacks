## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of cryptography and cybersecurity hacks I've found interesting to develop.

## Requirements

* `Kali Linux`.
*  Networking knowledge
* `Bash`
*  Text editor. E.g. `Sublime Text`, which is what I've used. Others to consider: `nano`, `gedit`, `VSCode` etc. Don't bother with an IDE; overkill!
* `Python 3.x`.
*  Compiler for `Modern C++`. I.e. `g++/gcc 13.1.0`.
* `C++`.
* `golang`.

## Topics Covered

Topics covered can be found in individual repositories.

1. `Reverse Cipher`.
2. `Caesar Cipher`.
